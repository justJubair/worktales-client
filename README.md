I've mainly discussed major five features of this website below

- I've used framer motion and AOS on homepage and also dynamic progress bar on bid request page.
- User can add a job and he or she can update or delete that job from my posted job route
- The job deadline is strict by Date.now() function. So if the date is passed user can't bid on that specific job.
- For user specific security I've used JWT token for every user and verifying the token on each and every private route.
- Job owner can accept and reject bids from biders on bid request page and biders can see their bids on my bids page.
